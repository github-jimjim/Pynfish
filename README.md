# Pynfish

**Author:** Jimmy Luong

## Overview
Pynfish is a Python-based chess engine that achieves an approximate Elo rating of **1500**. This was one of my first attempts at creating a chess engine. While I have since developed a more advanced version with an Elo of **3100**, I am not yet ready to share code on GitHub.

## Features
- Playable against Pynfish using:
  - `main.py`: Can be compiled and used in chess arenas like Lucas Chess or my self developed one.
  - `ui.py`: Provides a command-line interface for playing chess directly.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/github-jimjim/Pynfish.git
   cd pynfish
   ```
2. Run the UI to play:
   ```bash
   python ui.py
   ```
3. Compile `main.py` to use the engine in external chess arenas.

## Notes
Pynfish is a foundational project and represents my learning journey into chess engine development. The latest version, though more powerful, remains private for now.
